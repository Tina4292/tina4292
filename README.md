## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building full-stack web development projects for my CIS degree (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate everything i've learned in school into real world applications so I'm job ready!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I integrate creativity with technology
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-coppedge-computer-information-systems/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve been crocheting since I was 7, and Iâ€™m part of the Society for Creative Anachronismâ€”so I spend my time coding by day and recreating medieval crafts by night!
